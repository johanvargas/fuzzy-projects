Repo of small stand-alone scripts, probably in py. Useless, useful, personal,testing etc...

Current scripts are:

Roman Numeral Converter : Converts up to 10000.

Port List game : Guessing game for some well-known ports.

Node Server : Just a server setup for now

Clean Directory : a better method is bash commands like find.
